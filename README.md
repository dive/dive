Hello there,

I am Artem, a director of engineering, mobile engineer, technical lead, and self-proclaimed DevOps who specialises in mobile development. I have been closely associated with the mobile industry for many years. I remember the first iPhone and the first beta version of Android (HTC Hero, I still love you!), remember the slogan "HTML is the future of mobile applications", and have seen the innovations conquer the world and the mobile industry unicorns emit their spirits.

And I am still in love with the mobile world.

Ah, yes, also an Emacs user, and now Zed.

On the boring side of things, I am a technology leader with over 20 years of experience in engineering, M&A, Zero to One, and scaling high-performing teams. Passionate about driving innovation, building new products, optimising technical processes, and integrating new technologies within large-scale organisations. Experienced in software architecture, AI integration, due diligence, and fostering collaboration between tech and business. Expertise in AI pipelines, assessing legal risks in AI adoption, and embedding AI-driven solutions into product development. Skilled in mobile development, build systems, and lean methodologies within complex engineering environments.

✅ Business-oriented technical advisor  
✅ Consultant for engineering projects, startup scaling, or early-stage development  
✅ Fractional CTO
