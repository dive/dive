Hello there,

I am Artem, a director of engineering, senior mobile engineer, technical lead and self-proclaimed DevOps who specializes in mobile development. I am closely associated with the mobile industry for many years, I remember the first iPhone and the first beta version of Android (HTC Hero, I still love you!), remember the slogan "HTML is the future of mobile applications", and I have seen the innovations conquer the world, and the mobile industry unicorns emit their spirits.

And I am still in love with the mobile world.

Ah, yes, and also an Emacs user.
